### Introduction

[Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) (1887-1920) is one of history's most gifted Mathematicians, sadly departing before he was even 33 years of age.

```{r,out.width="25%",echo=F,fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/Srinivasa_Ramanujan.jpg")
```

In 1917 Srinivasa discovered several formulas for π. The one below is known as the "[Ramanujan-Sato Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan%E2%80%93Sato_series)": 

```{r,echo=F,out.width="50%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/ramanujan-sato.png")
```

The incredible thing about this formula is its exponential speed of convergence (the tree large terms simplify to O((99^(-4k)*k^(-3/2)) for large k). In turn, the ratios must be at least the precision we would like to approximate π with. Below we show the growth of the three large terms in the series, and the exponent of their product, for k=1 to 5:

```{r,echo=F,warning=F,message=F}
library(magrittr)
stirlingFactorial <- function(k) sqrt(2*pi*k)*(k/exp(1))^k
stirlingLogFactorial <- function(k) k*log(n)-k+.5*log(2*pi*k)
approx_ratio <- function(k) 0.12698727186848194/(99^(4*k)*k^1.5)
tibble::tibble(k=1:5,
               `t1=(4k)!`=factorial(4*k),
               `t2=(k!)^4`=factorial(k)^4.,
               `t3=396^(4k)`=396^(4*k),
               `O[t1/(t2*t3)]`=log10(approx_ratio(k))%>%round) %>%
  knitr::kable(align = "crrr") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F,position="center")
```

Notice that for small k, $396^(4k)$ grows fastest, though above a certain k factorials will take over, k! ~ O(k^k).

53-bit doubles in `R` are limited to 22 significant digits. So for k>2, this term will be truncated. Take k=4 as an example:

```{r}
print(396^(4*4),digits=22)
```

Via the arbitrary-precision [Rmpfr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpfr/vignettes/Rmpfr-pkg.pdf) package (using 120 bits), we can see the above with its full 42 digits:

```{r}
Rmpfr::mpfr(396, 120)^(4*4)
```

Total integer precision is imperative in the series computation, so we start by loading the arbitrary-precision library.

### Load the arbitrary-precision library

We will be using 240 bits of precision:

```{r,message=F}
library(dplyr) # to use "%>%" and "tibble"
library(Rmpfr) # use this for arbitrary-precision floats
bits <- 240
```

One term of the R-S series and its front coefficient:

```{r}
sqrt2 <- sqrt(mpfr("2", bits))
rs_coeff <- 9801L/(2L*sqrt2)

rs_term <- function(k) {
  num <- factorial(4L*k)*(26390L*k+1103L)
  den <- (factorial(k)*(396L^k))^4L
  num/den
}
```

Computes π w/ kmax iterations of the R-S formula (reciprocal of original formula):

```{r}
rs_series <- function(kmax) {
  terms <- rs_term(mpfr(0:(kmax-1),bits))
  (rs_coeff/cumsum(terms))
}
```

### Calculate π

Only 5 iterations and we're pretty close:

```{r}
rs_series(5)
```

Obtains high-precision π computed internally by `mpfr` package:

```{r}
piMpfr <- Const("pi",bits)
piMpfr
```

Order of error vs iteration, notice we are expanding the accuracy by 8 digits per iteration:

```{r,echo=F,kable.NA=F}
get_dev_exp <- function(v1,v2) abs(v1-v2) %>% log10 %>% round %>% asNumeric()
tibble(iter=1:5,
       error=get_dev_exp(rs_series(5),piMpfr),
       newDigits=lag(error)-error) %>%
  #purrr::set_names("iter","$|\\pi_{rs}-\\pi_{mpfr}|$","new digits") %>%
  knitr::kable(escape=F)
```

Mind-blowing convergence to the value of π afforded by the Ramanujan-Sato series! `r emo::ji("smile")`
